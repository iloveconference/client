<h5 class="header">Why I Love Conference?</h5>

<p>
	I (Dallan Quass) have been doing machine learning for 20 years. I love the work that I do and
	wanted to create a website that combined my professional and spiritual interests.
</p>
<p>
	Working on <em>I Love Conference</em> increases my professional skill and more importantly increases
	my love for Jesus Christ through the teachings of His prophets and apostles.
</p>

		If you are a developer, the code is
		<a href="https://github.com/iloveconference">open source</a>. The front-end is in SvelteKit and
		the back-end is in Python. I'd love your help, even if you don't (yet) know machine learning.

	<li>
		<em>I Love Conference</em> costs money to host each month. If you are interested in helping to fund
		the hosting costs, please contact me.
